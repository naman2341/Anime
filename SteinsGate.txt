Watch Order:
->Steins Gate Full(till epi 23) [Epi 23 has 2 versions, one is normal and other is 23-B, so watch the normal one, not the 23-B]
->Steins Gate OVA(epi 24)
Steins Gate was a 9 for me till the OVA
---------------
If you want to watch Steins;Gate 0, then first watch
->Steins Gate Episode 23-B(Only if wanna watch Steins;Gate 0)
This is different from the normal epi 23, so the 2nd half of the epi is a prequel to Steins;Gate 0
->Steins Gate 0(Full)
Steins;Gate 0 makes Steins Gate a 10 for me, and Steins;Gate 0 was a 9 for me
